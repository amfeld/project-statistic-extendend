        ODOO V18 ENTERPRISE INTEGRATION - STANDARD ACCOUNTING MECHANISMS
        ==============================================================================

        This module integrates seamlessly with Odoo v18 Enterprise Accounting and
        Analytic Accounting by following standard Odoo mechanisms:

        1. ANALYTIC DISTRIBUTION (Odoo v18 Standard)
           - Uses analytic_distribution JSON field on account.move.line
           - Replaces the old analytic_account_id approach from Odoo <v18
           - Supports multi-dimensional analytics with percentage distribution

        2. CUSTOMER INVOICES & CREDIT NOTES
           - Read directly from account.move.line with move_type in ['out_invoice', 'out_refund']
           - Automatically excludes deferred revenue journal entries (move_type='entry')
           - Handles partial analytic distribution (percentage-based)
           - Calculates both NET (price_subtotal) and GROSS (price_total)

        3. VENDOR BILLS & REFUNDS
           - Read directly from account.move.line with move_type in ['in_invoice', 'in_refund']
           - Automatically excludes deferred expense journal entries (move_type='entry')
           - Handles partial analytic distribution (percentage-based)
           - Calculates both NET and GROSS amounts

        4. DEFERRED EXPENSES & REVENUE (Odoo v18 Standard Feature)
           - When using deferred expenses/revenue, Odoo creates journal entries (move_type='entry')
           - These are AUTOMATICALLY EXCLUDED from double-counting:
             * Customer invoices: Only count out_invoice, not deferral entries
             * Vendor bills: Only count in_invoice, not deferral entries
             * Other Costs: Explicitly exclude all move_type='entry'
           - This ensures costs/revenue are counted only once, not per deferral period

        5. TIMESHEETS (hr_timesheet)
           - Read from account.analytic.line with is_timesheet=True
           - Automatically created by Odoo when timesheets are logged
           - Includes HFC factor adjustments for adjusted labor costs

        6. OTHER COSTS
           - Read from account.analytic.line with is_timesheet=False
           - EXCLUDES all accounting move types to prevent double-counting:
             * in_invoice, in_refund (vendor bills - counted separately)
             * out_invoice, out_refund (customer invoices - counted separately)
             * entry (journal entries including deferrals - not real costs)
           - INCLUDES only:
             * Manual analytic entries without move_line_id
             * Non-standard cost entries not covered above

        7. CASH DISCOUNTS (Skonto) - German Accounting
           - Detected via specific account codes (7300-7303, 2130, 4730-4733, 2670)
           - Counted separately from main costs/revenue
           - Supports both SKR03 and SKR04 chart of accounts

        CALCULATION APPROACH:
        ---------------------
        - NET basis: All calculations use NET (without tax) amounts
        - GROSS amounts: Provided for reference only
        - P&L calculations: Compare NET revenue to NET costs (apples to apples)
        - Adjusted costs: Apply surcharge factors and hourly rates

        TRIGGERS & DEPENDENCIES:
        ------------------------
        - account_id: Triggers recompute when project's analytic account changes
        - Hooks in account_move_line.py: Trigger when invoices/bills change
        - Hooks in account_analytic_line.py: Trigger when analytic lines change
        - Manual refresh: Via "Refresh Financial Data" wizard

        This ensures data is always synchronized with Odoo's accounting engine.

        This method reads from account.analytic.line and carefully excludes all
        entries that are already counted in other categories to prevent double-counting.

        EXCLUDED (already counted elsewhere):
        -------------------------------------
        1. Timesheets (is_timesheet=True)
           → Counted in labor_costs via _get_timesheet_costs()

        2. Customer Invoices (move_type='out_invoice', 'out_refund')
           → Counted in customer_invoiced_amount_net via _get_customer_invoices_from_analytic()

        3. Vendor Bills (move_type='in_invoice', 'in_refund')
           → Counted in vendor_bills_total_net via _get_vendor_bills_from_analytic()

        4. Journal Entries (move_type='entry')
           → These include:
             * Deferred Expenses: Auto-generated when using "Deferred Expense" on vendor bills
             * Deferred Revenue: Auto-generated when using "Deferred Revenue" on customer invoices
             * Manual Journal Entries: Typically not real project costs, just accounting adjustments
             * Inter-company transfers, currency adjustments, etc.
           → Excluding these prevents double-counting deferred costs/revenue

        5. Reversed/Cancelled Entries (reversed_entry_id exists)
           → Storno entries that cancel out original entries

        6. Cash Discount Accounts (Skonto: 7300-7303, 2130, 4730-4733, 2670)
           → Counted separately via _get_skonto_from_analytic()

        INCLUDED (real "other costs"):
        -------------------------------
        1. Manual analytic entries (no move_line_id)
           → Direct cost allocations to projects without accounting moves

        2. Non-standard cost entries
           → Costs from other modules or custom entries not covered above

        USAGE IN STANDARD ODOO V18:
        ---------------------------
        - When you post a vendor bill with deferred expenses, Odoo creates:
          a) Original bill entry (move_type='in_invoice') → Counted in Vendor Bills ✓
          b) Monthly deferral entries (move_type='entry') → Excluded here ✓
